## Course Description

This course introduces students to computer programming, electronics and physical interaction design. The bulk of the course will focus on the Arduino microcontroller for creating experiences that extend beyond the computer screen, while additional tools such as p5.js will be covered to extend the Arduino's capabilities. Weekly hands-on labs, assignments and readings will help students gain technical proficiency with these tools and develop a critical and creative eye for interactive technology.

## Course Materials

**Required**  
* [Arduino Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Starter-Kit-English-Official/dp/B009UKZV0A) (recommended) or ARDX Arduino Kit ([online](https://www.adafruit.com/product/170) or [local](http://tinkersphere.com/boards/1443-ardx-arduino-kit-nyc.html))
* 9V battery
* [Wires with alligator clips](https://www.amazon.com/SE-TL10-10-Piece-Alligator-Clips/dp/B0002KRABU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503435680&sr=8-1&keywords=alligator+clip+wires)

**Optional**  
* Bringing your own laptop is highly recommended.
* USB flash drive if using the lab computers.
* [Additional Parts and Supplies](https://github.com/chjno/MEDP349-Fall17/wiki/Additional-Parts-and-Supplies)

**Note:** It is likely that you will need additional materials depending on the nature of your projects. However, taking advantage of found and recycled materials is encouraged.

## Attendance and Participation

Attendance is mandatory for all class sessions. Unexcused absence or tardiness negatively impacts your attendance record and will damage your grade. If you anticipate being late or absent, speak to me as early as possible. Medical emergencies must be documented to be excused. If you cannot attend class on the day of a quiz, you must speak with me ahead of time in order to arrange for you to take it another time. This will only be done in cases where there is a well documented reason for missing the quiz.

Participation means:

* Being attentive and respectful when others are speaking or presenting.
  * During presentations, computers may not be used and all laptops must be closed.
* Contributing to in-class discussion, asking relevant questions and providing constructive feedback to your peers.
  * There are no dumb questions.
* Sharing your work each week and following along with in-class labs.
  * Failing to bring assignments and required materials to class will prevent you from participating.
* Contributing to the online discussion in the [issues section](https://github.com/chjno/MEDP349-Fall17/issues).
* Refraining from cell phone or internet usage during class.

## Assignments

This is a production heavy class. If you do not have your own computer, you will be able to access the labs outside of class. Room 478 also has computers with the relevant software installed.

You must post assignments to the [class homework page](https://github.com/chjno/MEDP349-Fall17/wiki/Homework) by 9pm the night before class. Bring your work to class each week and be prepared to talk about it. For each week an assignment is late, 10 points will be deducted from its grade.

Documentation of your work is required for all physical assignments. Refer to the [documentation guidelines](https://github.com/chjno/MEDP349-Fall17/wiki/Documentation-Guidelines).

## Academic Integrity

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g. plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The College is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.

## Disabilities

If you have a disability that will affect your coursework, please notify the
instructors within the first two weeks of class to ensure suitable arrangements and a
comfortable working environment. It is recommended that all students with documented
disabilities (emotional, medical, physical, and/or learning) consult the Office of
AccessABILITY, located in East Building1214B, to secure necessary academic
accommodations. For further information and assistance, please call 212-772-4857 or visit http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentservices/access/.
