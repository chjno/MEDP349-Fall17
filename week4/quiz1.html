    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Recreate the following sketches in p5.js. Feel free to use the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js reference</a>, the code examples from class or your own code. If you can't recreate the whole sketch, get as much as you can working and explain in a code comment how you think the rest of it should be coded in your own words <b>and/or</b> try to code the rest and comment out the broken code. This way I can see your thought process and your understanding of the core concepts. If you can explain the code properly but can't remember the syntax, function name, etc., or if you show me your broken code, this will potentially get you more points than if you don't show me your attempt to get it working at all.
        </li>
        <li>
            Log into your Github account, create a public <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> for each of your sketches and email the links to chjno.k@gmail.com
